--> Hypothesis  Testing:- 
      
      Hypothesis testing is the process in which we take out some sample data (small amount) from population data (huge data) 
for testing purpose. In Hypothesis first we take some sample data then we make initial assumptions on that data for either 
rejecting Null Hypothesis or accept Alternate Hypothesis.

       It represents two Mututal Exclusive statement - 
*    H0 - Null Hypothesis
*    H1 - Alternate Hypothesis

--> Steps of Hypothesis Testing:- 
 
     In Hypothesis Testing we take out some sample data and make initial assumptions on that step by step -

1.  We make initial assumption on the basis of Mutual Exclusive statement :- 
    Example - 
      H0  -  Null Hypothesis  ( India is a most populated Country.)
      H1  -  Alternate Hypothesis ( America is most populated Country.)

     So, here we will make assumptions either reject Null Hypothesis or  Alternate Hypothesis by using some test.

2.  Also then we collect some data on which we want to test.

3.  As we collect data to get the test for either reject Null hypothesis or accept Null Hypothesis.

      On the basis of test we will get to know either India is most populated country or America.

-->  Parameters of Hypothesis Testing:-

       We perform Hypothesis Testing on the basis of Null Hypothesis or Alternate Hypothesis. Also inorder to work 
on this Null or Alternate Hypothesis. We first get P value (significant value) on the basis of some test-

*  Chi Square test
*  T test
*  Anova test

     Once we get run any of these test. If significant value if less than the choosen significant then we reject the Null
Hypothesis and accept Alternate hypothesis.

-- P value  =  significant value
-- P value (<=0.05)   [ reject Null Hypothesis ]

     we run these different test on the basis of situation.
*  If we want to run a test on 2 categorical feature dataset, then we will use (Chi square test).
*  If we want to run a test on 1 categorical feature and 1 continuous (numerical) feature dataset, then we will use
     (T test) on this situation.
*  If we run a test on comparing continuous and categorical (multiple) feature dataset, then we use (Anova test).  

--> Errors in Hypothesis Testing:-

      Generally we get two type of errors in Hypothesis testing-
* Type 1 error:-  If we run test and reject Null Hypothesis. But in actual reality that Null Hypothesis true then we get this error.
* Type 2 error:- If we run test and accept Null Hypothesis and reject Alternate. we get this error because whatever we assumptions
            that's not true maybe because of available dataset, lack of knowledge etc.

1. What is hypothesis testing?

      Hypothesis testing is the process in which we take out some sample data (small amount) from population data (huge data) for 
testing purpose. In Hypothesis first we take some sample data then we make initial assumptions on that data for either rejecting 
Null Hypothesis or accept Alternate Hypothesis.

2. What is Null hypothesis and Alternate hypothesis?

     In Hypothesis, we take some sample data to make assumptions on that for final result. Also, we make assumptions on behalf of two mutual statement-
-Null Hypothesis:- In Hypothesis testing we reject Null Hypothesis statement if test significant value(P) is equal to or less than 0.05.

-Alternate Hypothesis:- Also we have to accept Alternate Hypothesis if test value is less than 0.05. If it’s more than 0.05 we have to accept it.

We reject or accept these statement on the basis of some test Like (chi test, t test, anova test).

3. Give some examples of hypothesis based statements?
     
      If we have dataset of a country where we want to make assumptions on population of country. So, we'll make assumptions on the basis of Null Hypothesis
or  Alternate Hypothesis.
         H0 - India is populated country
         H1 - India is not populated country.
So,  first we'll run test using test(t test) and suppose if P value is less than 0.05 then we'll reject this Null Hypothesis and select India is populated Country.

4.  What is p value?

    P value-  In Hypothesis testing we take some sample data out and make assumptions on that using some test like (chi test, anova test). Afterthat, we get 
significant value that’s called P Value. On the basis of P value we reject Null hypothesis or Alternate Hypothesis.

5.  Which test can be perfomed to get P value?

    In Hypothesis testing we perform some test to get P value or Significant value-
-->Chi test - we run t test on 2 categorical value.

-->T test. - we run test on 1 categorical and 1 continuous feature dataset.

-->Anova test - we run Anova test if in our datasets categorical and continuous value is more than  3-4.
