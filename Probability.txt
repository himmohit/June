--> Probability:-

         Probability is the number that deals with calculating the likelihood of a given event's occurence. It always expressed
with number between 0 to 1.

--> Mutual Exclusive and Mutual Inclusive Events:-

*    Mutual Exclusive Events:- In the Mutual Exclusive Events, it always occurs single events. It's means both events cannot occur at same time.
      Example:-  If we toss using a coin. then either it'll we had or tail at once. It cannot be both at same time.
      It represent with this-  P(A or B) = P(A) + PB(B)

*   Mutual Inclusive Events:- In the Mutual Inclusive Events, it allows both the events happen at same time.
      It represent with:-    P(A or B)  = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

--> Independent and Dependent Events:-

*    Independent Events:- In Independent Events, first outcomes doesn't affect the another happens.
      It represent with:-  P(A and B)  = P(A). P(B)

      Example:- If we toss a first coin if we get (head) then we toss second coin and we got (tail). So, it means first coin doesn't affect the
second coin occurence.

*    Dependent Events:- In Dependent Events, first outcomes it does affect the another happens.
       It represent with:-  P(A and B)  = P(A). P(B/A) 

      Example:- If we flip a coin we get (head) and again we flip second coin we got (head). It means first coin affects the occurence 
of second coin.

--> Conditional Probability:-

      Conditional Probability is the measure of an event occuring, given that another event already has occured.
      It represent with:- P(A/B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

--> Bayes Theorem:-

      It can be use to evaluate the conditional probability of event A, where event B is already occured, by knowing the conditional 
probability of event B, given that event A has already occured, allso the probabilites of events A and B.

     It represent with:- P(A/B) = [P(B/A)* P(A)] /  P(B)

-->  What is the probability of spinning a prime number or an odd number on a spinner numbered 1 to 8?

        S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

       P(prime) = 4/8 -->  1/2    P(odd) = 4/8 --> 1/2
       P(prime and odd)  = 3/8
       P(prime or odd)  = [1/2+1/2-3/8] = [1-3/8]  = 5/8

--> For numbers, one to nine, get the probability of getting a number less than 4 or 2?

      Numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

      Let P(A) = probability of less than 4 = 4/9
              P(B) = probability of less than 2 = 2/9

--> Let X and Y are two independent events such that P(X) = 0.3 and P(Y) = 0.7. Find P(X and Y), P(X or Y)?

       P(X and Y) = P(X)*P(Y)
                             = (0.3*0.7)
                             = 0.21

       P(X or B) = P(X) + P(Y)
                          = (0.3+0.7)
                          = 1.0 

--> A bag contains red and blue marbles. Two marbles are drawn without replacement. The probability of selecting a red marble and then a 
blue marble is 0.28. The probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is 0.5. What is the probability of selecting a blue 
marble on the second draw, given that the first marble drawn was red?

     P(B/R)  = P(B and R) / P(R)
                    = (0.28/0.5)  
                    =0.56
